## üîë Ghost Content API keys

All content is sourced from a Ghost CMS. By default, content is fetched from the demo location at `https://cms.gotsby.org`. Surely you want to source your own content. There are two ways to make your content keys available. Choose the method according to your build scenario.

### Building with cloud providers

If you build your project with a cloud provider (e.g. Gatsby, Netlify, Vercel), the best option is to provide the keys with environment variables:

| Key                   | Value (example)            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| GHOST_API_URL         | http:\/\/localhost:2368    |
| GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY | 9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942 |

The place where you can define them depends on the provider, but you usually find the option under the site settings. This avoids publishing keys in a public repository and is most secure.

### Building locally

If you build locally or on a private network where the build directory is not accessible to the world, you can safely add a new `.ghost.json` file in your base directory with the following JSON structure:

```bash

    {
        "development": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        },
        "production": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        }
    }
```

This file is part of `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally publishing it to your public repository. Change the `apiUrl` and `contentApiKey` to match your own Ghost CMS Content API keys.

&nbsp;

## ü§Ø Ensure headless mode of Ghost CMS

For best SEO results it is strongly recommended to disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by selecting the _Make this site private_ flag within your Ghost admin settings. This enables password protection in front of the Ghost install and sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` so your Gatsby front-end becomes the authoritative source for search engines.

&nbsp;

## üîß Update

It is recommended to install [npm-upgrade](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-upgrade) with `sudo npm install npm-upgrade -g`. Change into the base directory and update all packages with:

```bash
    npm-upgrade
```

You will be prompted to update all packages within your `package.json` file. Next, download the new packages:

```bash
    yarn
    yarn clean
```

The update process is now complete and you can start a new build with `yarn build` (or `yarn develop`).
